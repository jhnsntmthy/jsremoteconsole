You should have jQuery installed on your site already:

To Play with this, open your JS console and type

    $.getScript( "//jsremoteconsole.meteor.com/logger.js" )

Then you will have a function called "log" available to you. Call it like:

    log("Javascript is awesomerest with Meteor", "log")

    log("You are successfully logging remotely", "success")

    log("Uh oh", "error")

All the while, watch what happens live at http://jsremoteconsole.meteor.com
